MCP Server Manager is an Electron + React (MUI) desktop GUI for starting/stopping, monitoring, logging, and exposing MCP servers via ngrok. The repo is organized into `src/main` (Electron main process, IPC handlers, and services like Config/Process/Log/Ngrok/HttpsProxy managers), `src/preload` (safe IPC bridge), and `src/renderer` (React + Zustand UI pages/components). App data lives under `~/.mcpm` (config, certs, logs).
